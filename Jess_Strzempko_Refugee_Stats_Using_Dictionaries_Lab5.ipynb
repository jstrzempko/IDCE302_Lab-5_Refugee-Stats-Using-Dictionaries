        "This script creates a small dictionary of refugee camp popuations and iterates through it to create basic outputs. First, the script creates a dictionary with 5 key-value pairs consisting of a country name and an integer representing the population of refugee camps in this country for the latest year of data (2014). [Refugee camp populations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp) were sourced from a Wikipedia data table. Two functions are created - one to print the keys in the key-value pairs and the other to print the values using for loops. Both functions are called on the refugee dictionary. A last function is created and called to print out a series of statements with how many refugees are in each country with the format: \"CountryX has 1234567 refugees.\"\n",
